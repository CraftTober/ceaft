<h2>
Today, date 3Feb.2022. I started my channel
and posted my first video on this channel 
and i thought that when i woke up and saw 
i got reached 100k subs in just 1 day but 
it was only my dream in reality it was not 
100k subs it's just 1 sub and that was me.
But i never give up and posted many videos
and then my video went viral after a month 
of posting that video and reached 3400 
views on YT. I was surprised about that 
i got 76 subs and i told my brother and 
he also got shocked. Date 25May.2022, 
Again i posted a video and that video 
goes more viral than any other video and 
got 1000 views just in one day.
 After five days of posting that video 
 got 6300 views. This is my short
 story of my channel.
